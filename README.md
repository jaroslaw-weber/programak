# features


## colemak dh as base layer

colemak dh is nice, ergonomic layout.

## no home row mods

home row mods can be nice but can be tricky to master. also it can hold your speed a bit.
switch layers and use mods without holding any key!

## thumb one-shot symbol layer

tap right thumb to access symbol layer easily. programming uses a lot of symbols so this layer needs to be easily accessible.

layer is exited after one symbol. this is because we often want to write only one symbol.

## toggle layer with mouse and arrows

when programming we use arrows a lot so it's good to have easy access to this layer.
toggle with left pinky is easily accessible and dont need to hold so it's more ergonomic.

## easy access to tab (intellisense/ai autocomplete)

for intellisense or when using ai autocomplete (tablnine) we often use TAB. this key needs good access so it's under the thumb

## easy access to space

obviously. under the thumb (similar to normal space)

## emergency QWERTY layout

in case you need to write in korean/japanese or want to share keyboard to a coworker.

## enter on right pink

its easy to access and easy to remember (samem as normal keyboard)

## mod keys on pinkies

just shift your hand a bit and easily access those mods.

## symbol layer with focus on typescript

most used symbols are on home row.

## symbol layer easy to remember

symbols are grouped in logical order

## swapped comma with dot

programmers use dot more often than comma so now can type dot with middle finger easily.

## second symbol layer for rare symbols

how often do you really close parentheses? these days it can often be autocompleted,
especially with ai. put those on separate symbols layer that can be accessed with same key
as symbol layer (double tap to get second symbol layer)

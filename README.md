# programak
alternative comfort-focused keyboard layout for programmers

![](programak.png)

# why colors?

symbol keys are grouped by colors. similar (grouped) symbols are using same color.
use this picture to learn the layout.

# how to use

In order to type symbols, press "switch layer" key once and then key with symbol. after typing symbol once, layout will switch back to letters layer.
Delete keys with your right pinky.

# design decisions

1. switch layer without holding shift

    Typing symbols often include holding shift and then pressing key with symbol. Pressing once is more comfortable than holding the key.
2. layout switch back to alphabet after you type symbol

    When programming, symbols are often typed between words (variables, functions etc). So going back to letters after typing symbol is more comfortable.
3. swapped comma with dot

    When programming we use dot more often than comma. The positions are the same as colemak (easier to remember), just swapped.
4. calculation symbols next to each other

    When symbol keys are next to each other, the layout is easier to remember.
5. parenthesis symbols on home row

    When programming we use a lot of parenthesis (writing functions) so they should be in most comfortable place (home row)
6. backspace with pinky finger

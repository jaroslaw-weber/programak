# Installation on macos

1. Install Karabinier elements

2. Put "karabinier.json" in karabinier settings folder

3. Put "ProgramakV2.keylayout" in "Library/Keyboard Layouts" folder

4. Open system settings and go to "keyboard layouts"

5. Add "Other > ProgramakV2"

6. Switch keyboard to ProgramakV2 and restart Karabinier

## Small difference

"switch layer" key is in the same place but "backspace/delete" is moved one key to the right.

## TODO

Currently control key in not mapped so you may need to add "simple modification" and move it to another key
